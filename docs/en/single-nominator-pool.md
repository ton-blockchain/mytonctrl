# Single Nominator Pool

[Single Nominator](https://github.com/orbs-network/single-nominator) is a new TON smart contract that enables secure validation for TON blockchain via an air gapped cold wallet.The contract is designed for TON validators that have enough self stake to validate by themselves without relying on third-party nominators.

The contract provides an alternative simplified implementation for the core team’s Nominator Pool smart contract that supports a single nominator only. The benefit of this implementation is that it's more secure since the attack surface is considerably smaller. This is due to a massive reduction in complexity of the Nominator Pool that has to support multiple third-party nominators.

## Start using mytonctrl

Currently [mytonctrl](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/mytonctrl) supports `single_nominator` contracts, but firstly you need to install mytonctrl 2.0.

### Launch mytonctrl 2.0

If you already have installed mytonctrl just use command `update mytonctrl2`. If you have no mytonctrl installed, follow these steps:

1. Download installation script:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ton-blockchain/mytonctrl/mytonctrl2/scripts/install.sh
```

2. Run installation script:

```bash
sudo bash ./install.sh -b mytonctrl2
```

### Set up single-nominator

After you have [created](/participate/run-nodes/full-node#import-existed-account) and [activated](/participate/run-nodes/full-node#activate-the-wallets) validator's wallet, follow these steps:

1. Enable single nominator mode

```bash
MyTonCtrl> enable_mode single-nominator
```

2. Check if single-nominator mode is enabled.

```bash
MyTonCtrl> status_modes
Name              Status             Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
single-nominator  enabled   Orbs's single nominator pools.                                                                                                            
```

3. Create pool

```bash
MyTonCtrl> new_single_pool <pool-name> <owner_address>
```

If you have already created pool it's possible to import it:

```bash
MyTonCtrl> import_pool <pool-name> <pool-addr>
```

4. Type `pools_list` to display pool addresses

```bash
MyTonCtrl> pools_list
Name       Status  Balance  Version   Address                                           
test-pool  empty   0.0      spool_r2  kf_JcC5pn3etTAdwOnc16_tyMmKE8-ftNUnf0OnUjAIdDJpX  
```

5. Send 1 TON to the pool and activate it

```bash
MyTonCtrl> activate_single_pool <pool-name>
```

After successfully activated wallet:

```bash
MyTonCtrl> pools_list
Name       Status  Balance  Version   Address                                           
test-pool  active  0.99389  spool_r2  kf_JcC5pn3etTAdwOnc16_tyMmKE8-ftNUnf0OnUjAIdDJpX  
```

Now you can work with this pool via mytonctrl like with a standard nominator pool.

## Start without mytonctrl

#### Prepare launched Validator

If you have mytonctrl installed and validator running:

1. Stop validation and withdraw all funds.

#### Prepare from the beginning
If you had no Validator before, do the following:
1. [Run a Validator](/participate/run-nodes/full-node) and make sure it's synced.
2. Stop validation and withdraw all funds.


### Prepare Single Nominator


1. Install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en) v.16 and later and npm  ([detailed instructions](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#debian-and-ubuntu-based-distributions))

2. Install `ts-node` and `arg` module

```bash
$ sudo apt install ts-node
$ sudo npm i arg -g
```

4. Create symlinks for compilers:

```bash
$ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/ton/crypto/fift /usr/local/bin/fift
$ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/ton/crypto/func /usr/local/bin/func
```

5. Run test to make sure everything is set up properly:

```bash
$ npm run test
```

6. Replace mytonctrl nominator-pool scripts: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orbs-network/single-nominator/main/mytonctrl-scripts/install-pool-scripts.sh

### Create Single Nominator Pool

1. Get Toncenter API key from a Telegram [@tonapibot](https://t.me/tonapibot)
2. Set env variables:

```bash
export OWNER_ADDRESS=<owner_address>
export VALIDATOR_ADDRESS=<validator_wallet_address>
export TON_ENDPOINT=https://toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC
export TON_API_KEY=<toncenter api key>
```

2. Create deployer address:

```bash
$ npm run init-deploy-wallet
Insufficient Deployer [EQAo5U...yGgbvR] funds 0
```

3. Topup deployer address with 2.1 TON
4. Deploy pool contract, you will get pool address: `Ef-kC0..._WLqgs`:

```
$ npm run deploy
```

5. Convert address to .addr:

```
$ fift -s ./scripts/fift/str-to-addr.fif Ef-kC0..._WLqgs
```

(Saving address to file single-nominator.addr)

6. Backup deployer private key "./build/deploy.config.json" and "single-nominator.addr" files
7. Copy "single-nominator.addr" to "mytoncore/pools/single-nominator-1.addr"
8. Send stake from owner address to single nominator address

### Withdrawals from Single Nominator

Using wallets to withdraw from Single Nominator
Fift:

1. Create "withdraw.boc" request with amount:

```bash
$ fift -s ./scripts/fift/withdraw.fif <withdraw_amount>
```

2. Create and sign request from owner's wallet:

```bash
$ fift -s wallet-v3.fif <my-wallet> <single_nominator_address> <sub_wallet_id> <seqno> <amount=1> -B withdraw.boc
```

3. Broadcast query:

```bash
$ lite-client -C global.config.json -c 'sendfile wallet-query.boc'
tons
```

1. Create "withdraw.boc" request with amount:

```bash
$ fift -s ./scripts/fift/withdraw.fif <withdraw_amount>
```

2. Send request to single nominator address:

a.

```bash
$ tons wallet transfer <my-wallet> <single_nominator_address> <amount=1> --body withdraw.boc
tonkeeper
```

b.

```
npm link typescript
```

c.

```
npx ts-node scripts/ts/withdraw-deeplink.ts <single-nominator-addr> <withdraw-amount>
```

d. Open deeplink on the owner's phone

## Deposit pool

1. Go to the pool’s page https://tonscan.org/nominator/<pool_address>.

2. Make sure that the information about the pool is fully displayed, if the pool has the wrong smart contract, there will be no information.

3. Press the `ADD STAKE` button or scan the QR-code using Tonkeeper or any other TON Wallet.

4. After you are transferred to the wallet, please, enter the amount of TON and then send the transaction. After that TON coins will be added to staking.

If the wallet does not open automatically, you can send the transaction manually by copying the pool address. Send it through any TON wallet. From the sent transaction, 1 TON will be debited as a commission for processing the deposit.

You can also make a deposit using mytonctrl, using the following commands:

```sh
MyTonCtrl> mg <from-wallet-name> <pool-account-addr> <amount>
```

or

```sh
MyTonCtrl> deposit_to_pool <pool-addr> <amount>
```

which deposits pool from validation wallet.

**MyTonCtrl** will automatically join the elections. You can set the stake amount that mytonctrl sends to [Elector contract](/develop/smart-contracts/governance#elector) ~ every 18 hours.

```sh
MyTonCtrl> set stake 50000
```
Minimal stake amount could be found using `status` command.

## Stop participating (withdraw)

If user doesn't want to take part in validating anymore it's possible to withdraw all funds from the Single Nominator contract to validators personal wallet. To get coins back after staking, send 1 TON to the pool’s address, add a comment **w** (small letter) to the transaction. This 1 TON minus commission will be returned, and a smart-contract will understand that you want to bring the coins back and it will send them back right after the end of the validator’s work cycle. It usually takes up to 18 hours.

You can also withdraw funds using the following command:

```sh
MyTonCtrl> withdraw_from_pool <pool-addr> <amount>
```

Or you can create and send transaction manually:

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="toncore" label="JS (@ton)">

```js
import { Address, beginCell, internal, storeMessageRelaxed, toNano } from "@ton/core";

async function main() {
    const single_nominator_address = Address.parse('single nominator address');
    const WITHDRAW_OP = 0x1000
    const amount = 50000

    const messageBody = beginCell()
        .storeUint(WITHDRAW_OP, 32) // op code for withdrawal
        .storeUint(0, 64)           // query_id
        .storeCoins(amount)         // amount to withdraw
        .endCell();

    const internalMessage = internal({
        to: single_nominator_address,
        value: toNano('1'),
        bounce: true,
        body: messageBody
    });
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="tonconnect" label="Golang">

```go
func WithdrawSingleNominatorMessage(single_nominator_address string, query_id, amount uint64) (*tonconnect.Message, error) {

	const WITHDRAW_OP = 0x1000

	payload, _ := cell.BeginCell().
		MustStoreUInt(WITHDRAW_OP, 32). // op code for withdrawal
		MustStoreUInt(query_id, 64).    // query_id
		MustStoreCoins(amount).         // amount to withdraw
		EndCell().MarshalJSON()

	msg, err := tonconnect.NewMessage(
		single_nominator_address,
		tlb.MustFromTON("1").Nano().String(), // nanocoins to transfer/compute message
		tonconnect.WithPayload(payload))

	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	return msg, nil
}
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>


## Election process

1. Check that election has been already started:

```bash
MyTonCtrl> status
```

and for Testnet:

```bash
MyTonCtrl> status fast
```

As example:

```sh
MyTonCtrl> status fast
===[ TON network status ]===
Network name: testnet
Number of validators: n/a(15)
Number of shardchains: 4
Number of offers: 0(0)
Number of complaints: 0(0)
Election status: closed
```

2. If the election has been started and Single Nominator Pool is activated, validator should **automatically** send **ElectorNewStake** message to Elector contract.

Check validator wallet:

```sh
MyTonCtrl> wl
Name                  Status  Balance           Ver  Wch  Address                                           
validator_wallet_001  active  995.828585374     v1   -1   kf_dctjwS4tqWdeG4GcCLJ53rkgxZOGGrdDzHJ_mxPkm_Xct  
```

Then check it transaction history:

```sh
MyTonCtrl> vas kf_dctjwS4tqWdeG4GcCLJ53rkgxZOGGrdDzHJ_mxPkm_Xct
Address                                           Status  Balance        Version

## Delete pool

It's also possible to delete local pool:

```bash
MyTonCtrl> delete_pool <pool-name>
```

## Transitioning a Regular Validator to Nominator Pool Mode

1. Input set stake 0 to discontinue election participation.
2. Await the return of both your stakes from the elector.
3. Proceed with the following [steps](/participate/network-maintenance/single-nominator#set-up-single-nominator).
